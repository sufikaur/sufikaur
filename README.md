### About Me

I'm a 4th-year undergraduate student working towards a combined BS/MS in Computer Science and Cognitive Psychology at Northeastern University.

I am passionate about understanding, critiquing, and promoting transparency in artificial intelligence algorithms and connecting psychological theories in areas including childhood development, cognition, morality, and memory to computing.

I also love to dance, play the guitar, play word games, run, watch old movies, and eat any variation of chocolate ice cream :)
